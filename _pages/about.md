**I am always looking for strong, self-motivated students. ** If you are interested, please reach out. 

My research interests lie in the areas of Machine Learning and Human-Computer Interaction. In particular,
I am interested in developing creative ML-based techniques to help address the unique needs of individuals. 
Much of my current interest is in the development of multimodal methods that can 
improve AI's understanding of nuanced human behaviors. Additionally, how this understanding can be used to responsibly integrate intelligent automation into social contexts.

I run the [Assistive Intelligence Lab](/lab). We are always welcoming of students! You can find more information on the [prospective students](/students) page.
