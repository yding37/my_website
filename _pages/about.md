**Multiple positions open! I am looking to hire 5 PhD students for Fall 2024.**

**Students with interests in all areas of ML, HCI, Trustworthy AI, Social Computing, and others are encouraged to contact me.**

My research interests lie in the areas of Machine Learning and Human-Computer Interaction. In particular,
I am interested in developing creative ML-based techniques to help address the unique needs of individuals. 
Much of my current interest is in the development of multimodal methods that can 
improve AI's understanding of nuanced human behaviors, and how this understanding can be effectively integrated into social contexts.

I run the [Assistive Intelligence Lab](/lab) and also a Co-PI in the Center for Integrated AI Research at the Edge (<a href="https://titan.cs.gsu.edu/~ciare/">CiARE</a>). We are always welcoming of students! You can find more information on the [prospective students](/students) page.
