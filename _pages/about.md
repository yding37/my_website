My research interests lie in the areas of Machine Learning and Human-Computer Interaction. In particular,
I am interested in developing creative ML-based techniques to help address the unique needs of individuals. 
Much of my current interest is in the development of multimodal methods that can 
improve AI's understanding of nuanced human behaviors, and how this understanding can be effectively integrated into social contexts. I run the Assistive Intelligence Lab, come check us out!

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
