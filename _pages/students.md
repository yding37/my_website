If you are interested in research please come join our regular lab meetings!

Please also reach out to one of the (current) lab members. We work on a range of problems in multimodal machine learning including natural language processing, computer vision, and speech and language processing. We are also working on human-computer interaction problems relevant to the use of these technolgies, human behavioral research, and much more!
